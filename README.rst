:Description: Cookbook to install solrcloud on an aws opsworks stack

## Foreword

This cookbook can be used to install SolrCloud on an aws OpsWorks stack.

It uses the solrcloud cookbooks to install solr in a cloud mode with an external zookeeper service.
By now we install zookeeper on each node and use exhibitor to discover the zookeeper instances
with our chef cookbook

## Usage

You need to:

1. Create a new stack
    * Enable "Manage Berkshelf" (to enable the evaluation of Berksfile)
    * Use Berkshelf version 3.1.3

2. Create a custom layer with the name "solrcloud"
    * Include the git repository as custom chef recipes
    * Map the custom recipes to the events:
        * Setup: opsworks_solrcloud::setup
        * Configure: opsworks_solrcloud::configure
        * Deploy: opsworks_solrcloud::deploy
        * Undeploy: opsworks_solrcloud::undeploy


## Notes

By now we use the first node in the cluster as exhibitor endpoint to
retrieve all active zookeeper nodes. It might make sence to run zookeeper and exhibitor
on another stack and support this in this cookbook.

## Usage

You can use

http://fistclusternode:8080/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html

to access the ui of the exhibitor, which is used to manage the zookeeper instances.

When the cookbook was executed successful you should also be able to access solr cloud with one
of the cluster hostname

e.g:

http://fistclusternode:8983/solr/

and your elastic load balancer should could also be configured to load balance requests to this port
to all active instances.
